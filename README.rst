Sinatra Application
----------------------

This is a Sinatra application for student management.  This is a homework assignment for COEN 278 - Web Programming II at Santa Clara University with Professor Yaun Wang.
The project involves a simple database for adding student information including their name and birthday and then the ability to manage those students.  Student information can be edited and deleted.

Most of the endpoints are protected.  There is only one username and password.
